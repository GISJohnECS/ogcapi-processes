=== Overview

This clause specifies two pre-defined requirements classes for encodings to be
used with the OGC API Processes.

* <<rec_json,JSON>>
* <<rc_html,HTML>>

The JSON encoding is mandatory.

The <<rc_core,Core>> requirements class includes recommendations to support
<<rec_html,HTML>> and <<rec_json,JSON>> as encodings, where practical.
