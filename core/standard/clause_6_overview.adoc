== Overview

This standard does not mandate any encoding or format for representing features or
feature collections. In addition to HTML as the standard encoding for Web content,
rules for commonly used encodings for spatial data on the web are provided
(GeoJSON, GML).

None of these encodings is mandatory and an implementation of the "Core"
requirements class may also decide to use none of them, but to use another encoding
instead.

<<rec_html,Support for HTML is recommended>> as HTML is the core language of the World Wide Web.
A server that supports HTML will support browsing the data with a web browser
and it will enable search engines to crawl and index the processes.
