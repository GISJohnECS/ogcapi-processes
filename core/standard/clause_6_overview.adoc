=== Operations on WPS resources

In general, the HTTP GET operation is used to provide access to the resources described above.
However, in order to create a new job, the HTTP POST method is used to crate a new job by sending an execute request to the server. The operation is listed in <<table_job_creation>> below.

|Create a new job |`/processes/{processID}/jobs` |POST| Execute request (contained in body) |<<_create_a_new_job,7.11 Create a new job>>

This standard uses JSON as encoding for requests and responses. The inputs and outputs of a process can have any format. The formats of are defined at the time of job creation and are fixed for the specific job.

<<rec_html,Support for HTML is recommended>> as HTML is the core language of the World Wide Web.
A server that supports HTML will support browsing the data with a web browser
and it will enable search engines to crawl and index the processes.
