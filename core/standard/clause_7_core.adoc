== Requirement Class "Core"

////
for now, normative statements are often included inline. This will be re-factored later.
////

=== Overview

include::requirements/requirements_class_core.adoc[]

TODO: Overview?

In addition, each server publishes a formal definition of the API (`APIDefinition`),
which describes the capabilities of the server and which can be used by
clients to connect to the server or
by development tools to support the implementation of servers and clients.

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/30[ISSUE 30] +
Allow also features that do not belong to any collection?

=== API definition

Every WFS is defined by an API definition that describes the capabilities
of the server and which can be used by clients to connect to the server or
by development tools to support the implementation of servers and clients.

include::requirements/requirement_api-definition.adoc[]

The API definition document is the "landing page" point" for the API. I.e.,
there is no need to include the `/api` operation in the API definition itself.

=== HTTP 1.1

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/http +

The server SHALL conform to <<rfc2616,HTTP 1.1>>.
|===

This includes the correct use of status codes, headers, etc.

=== Web caching

Entity tags are a mechanism for web cache validation and for supporting conditional
requests to reduce network traffic. Entity tags are specified by <<rfc2616,HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2616)>>.

[[rec_etag]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/etag +

The service SHOULD support entity tags and the associated headers as
specified by HTTP/1.1.
|===

NOTE: TODO +
Add an example OpenAPI operation (headers, response codes). Here or in clause 9.

=== Support for cross-origin requests

To access data from a HTML page where the data is on another host than
the webpage is by default prohibited for security reasons ("same-origin policy").
A typical example is a web-application accessing feature data from
multiple distributed datasets.

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/cross-origin +

If the server is intended to be accessed from the browser, cross-origin
requests SHOULD be supported. Note that support can also be added in a
proxy layer on top of the server.
|===

Two common mechanisms to support cross-origin requests are:

* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing[Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)]
* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP[JSONP (JSON with padding)]

[[rec_html]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/html +

To support browsing a WFS with a web browser and to enable search engines to crawl
and index a dataset, implementations SHOULD consider to support an HTML encoding.
|===

[[rec_geojson]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/geojson +

If the feature data can be represented for the intended use in GeoJSON,
implementations SHOULD consider to support GeoJSON as an
encoding for features and feature collections.
|===

<<overview,Clause 6 (Overview)>> includes a discussion about the recommended
encodings.

A template for the definition of the parameter `f` in YAML according to OpenAPI 3.0 is available at
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/parameters/f.yaml[f.yaml].

=== Process collection

==== Operation

include::requirements/requirement_process-collection-op.adoc[]

==== Response

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/process-collection-success +

A successful execution of the operation SHALL be reported as a response with a
HTTP status code `200`.

The content of that response SHALL be based upon the OpenAPI 3.0 schema link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/schemas/content.yaml[content.yaml].
|===

|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-md-links +

A "200"-response SHALL include the following links in the `links` property
of the response:

* a link to this response document (relation: `self`),
* a link to the response document in every other media type supported by
the server (relation: `alternate`),
* links to each feature collection resource in this distribution of the
dataset for each supported encoding (relation: `item`), and
* links to the API definition document in each supported encoding
(relation: `service`).

All links SHALL include the `rel` and `type` link parameters.
|===

[[fc_md_descriptions]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/fc-md-descriptions +

If external schemas or descriptions for the dataset exist that provide
information about the structure or semantics of the data, a "200"-response
SHOULD include links to each of those resources in the `links` property
of the response (relation: `describedBy`).

The `type` link parameter SHOULD be provided for each link.

This applies to resources that describe to the whole dataset. For
resources that describe the contents of a feature collection, the
links SHOULD be set in the `links` property of the appropriate
object in the `collections` resource.

Examples for descriptions are: XML Schema, Schematron, JSON Schema,
RDF Schema, OWL, SHACL, a feature catalogue, etc.
|===

NOTE: TODO +
Add recommendation about a link to the distribution resource in the dataset
metadata (example in DCAT). Which link relation type?

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-md-items +

.Feature collection metadata response document
=================
This feature collection metadata example response in JSON is for a dataset with
a single collection "buildings". It includes links to the collection resource in all formats that
are supported by the service (link:https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml[link relation type]: "item").

Representations of the metadata resource in other formats are referenced using link:https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml[link relation type] "alternate".

Additional links to a GML application schema for the building data and to
a web page that has additional information about buildings are provided, too, using link:https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml[link relation type] "describedBy".

Coordinate reference system information is not provided as the service provides
geometries only in the default system (WGS84 longitude/latitude).

=== Feature collections

==== Operation

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-op +
 +

For every feature collection identified in the metadata about the feature collection (path "/"),
the server SHALL support the HTTP GET operation at the path `/{collectionId}`.

`collectionId` is the property of the same name in the feature collection metadata.
|===

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/17[ISSUE 17] +
Precision level filter responsibility?

==== Parameter startIndex

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-startIndex-definition +

Each feature collection operation SHALL support a parameter `startIndex`
with the following characteristics (using an OpenAPI Specification 3.0 fragment):

[source,YAML]
----
name: startIndex
in: query
required: false
schema:
  type: integer
  minimum: 0
  default: 0
style: form
explode: false
----
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-startIndex-response +

The optional `startIndex` parameter identifies the index within the result
set from which the server SHALL begin presenting results in the
response. The first element has an index of 0.
|===

A template for the definition of the parameter in YAML according to
OpenAPI 3.0 is available at
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/parameters/startIndex.yaml[startIndex.yaml].

==== Parameter count

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-count-definition +

Each feature collection operation SHALL support a parameter `count`
with the following characteristics (using an OpenAPI Specification 3.0 fragment):

[source,YAML]
----
name: count
in: query
required: false
schema:
  type: integer
  minimum: 1
  maximum: 10000
  default: 10
style: form
explode: false
----

The values for `maximum` and `default` are only examples and MAY be changed.
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-count-response +

The optional `count` parameter SHALL limit the number of items
that are presented in the response.

Only items are counted that are on the first level of the collection in the
response. Any nested objects contained within the explicitly requested items
SHALL not be counted.
|===

A template for the definition of the parameter in YAML according to
OpenAPI 3.0 is available at
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/parameters/count.yaml[count.yaml].

==== Parameter bbox

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-bbox-definition +

Each feature collection operation SHALL support a parameter `bbox`
with the following characteristics (using an OpenAPI Specification 3.0 fragment):

[source,YAML]
----
name: bbox
in: query
required: false
schema:
  type: array
  items:
    type: number
    minItems: 4
    maxItems: 4
    minimum: -180
    maximum: 180
style: form
explode: false
----
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-bbox-response +

Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding box SHALL be
part of the result set, if the `bbox` parameter is provided.

The bounding box is provided as four numbers:

* Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
* Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
* Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
* Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
|===

For WGS84 longitude/latitude this is in most cases the sequence of
minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum latitude.
However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the first value
(west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box edge).

.The bounding box of the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone
=================
The bounding box of the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone in WGS84 (from 160.6°E to 170°W and from 55.95°S to 25.89°S)
would be represented in JSON as `[ 160.6, -55.95, -170, -25.89 ]`.
=================

A template for the definition of the parameter in YAML according to
OpenAPI 3.0 is available at
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/parameters/bbox.yaml[bbox.yaml].

==== Parameter resultType

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-resultType-definition +

Each feature collection operation SHALL support a parameter `resultType`
with the following characteristics (using an OpenAPI Specification 3.0 fragment):

[source,YAML]
----
name: resultType
in: query
required: false
schema:
  type: string
  enum:
    - hits
    - results
  default: results
style: form
explode: false
----
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-resultType-response +

A successful execution of the operation SHALL respond in one of two
ways. It may either generate a complete response containing resources that satisfy the
operation or it may simply generate an empty response container
that indicates the count of the total number of resources that the
operation would return. Which of these two responses is generated is
determined by the value of the optional resultType parameter.

The allowed values for this parameter are `results` and `hits`.

If the value of the resultType parameter is set to `results`, the server
SHALL generate a complete response document containing resources that
satisfy the operation.

If the value of the resultType attribute is set to `hits`, the server
SHALL generate an empty response document containing no resource
instances.

If the parameter is not provided, `results` is used.
|===

A template for the definition of the parameter in YAML according to
OpenAPI 3.0 is available at
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/parameters/resultType.yaml[resultType.yaml].

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/13[ISSUE 13] +
Support resultType that returns only the ids of the selected features?

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/16[ISSUE 16] +
Ability to set no null/empty geometry in returned response

==== Parameters for filtering on feature properties

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/20[ISSUE 20] +
Query parameter collisions.

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/fc-filters +

If features in the feature collection include a feature property that has a
simple value (for example, a string or integer) that is expected to be useful
for applications using the service to filter the features of the collection
based on this property, you SHOULD support a parameter with the name of the
feature property and with the following characteristics (using an
OpenAPI Specification 3.0 fragment):

[source,YAML]
----
in: query
required: false
style: form
explode: false
----

The `schema` property SHALL be the same as the definition of the feature
property in the response schema.
|===

.An additional parameter to filter buildings based on their function
=================
[source,YAML]
----
name: function
in: query
description: >-
  Only return buildings of a particular function.\

  Default = return all buildings.
required: false
schema:
  type: string
  enum:
    - residential
    - commercial
    - public use
style: form
explode: false
example: 'function=public+use'
----
=================

==== Response

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-response +

A successful execution of the operation SHALL be reported as a response with a
HTTP status code "200".
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-links +

A "200"-response SHALL include the following links:

* a link to this response document (relation: `self`),
* a link to the response document in every other media type supported
by the service (relation: `alternate`),
* a link to the previous "page", if the parameter `startIndex` was provided
with a value `i` with `i > 0` and `i mod c = 0` where `c` is the value for the
parameter `count` (relation: `prev`).
* a link to the next "page", if the parameter `startIndex` was provided with
a value `i` with `i + c < f` and `i mod c = 0` where `c` is the value for the
parameter `count` and `f` is the number of features in the collection (relation: `next`).

All links SHALL include the `rel` and `type` link parameters.
|===

NOTE: The representation of the links in the payload will depend on the encoding
of the feature collection.

.Links
=================
If the request is to return features from the 51st feature, using the default value of the `count` parameter "10", the links in the response could be (in this example represented as link headers):

[source]
----
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=json&startIndex=50>; rel="self"; type="application/geo+json"
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=xml&startIndex=50>; rel="alternate"; type="application/gml+xml;version=3.2"
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=html&startIndex=50>; rel="alternate"; type="text/html"
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=json&startIndex=40>; rel="prev"; type="application/geo+json"
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=json&startIndex=60>; rel="next"; type="application/geo+json"
----

If an explicit `count` of "50" is used, the links in the response could be:

[source]
----
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=json&startIndex=50&count=50>; rel="self"; type="application/geo+json"
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=xml&startIndex=50&count=50>; rel="alternate"; type="application/gml+xml;version=3.2"

Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=json&startIndex=0&count=50>; rel="prev"; type="application/geo+json"
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings?f=json&startIndex=100&count=50>; rel="next"; type="application/geo+json"
----
=================

////
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-timeStamp +

A "200"-response SHALL include a property `timeStamp` based upon the schema
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/schemas/timeStamp.yaml[timeStamp.yaml].
|===

The exception schema supports both JSON and XML encodings:

.link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/schemas/timeStamp.yaml[Schema for the timeStamp property]
[source,YAML]
----
timeStamp:
  description: This property indicates the time and date when the response was generated.
  type: string
  format: dateTime
  example: '2017-08-17T08:05:32Z'
  xml:
    attribute: true
----
////

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
TODO +
Add normative statements for the following information in the response:

* timeStamp: Indicates the time and date when the response was generated.
* numberMatched: The number of features of the feature type that match the
selection parameters like `bbox` or additional filter parameters.
* numberReturned: If the value is provided, the value shall be identical to the number
of items in the "features" array. A server may omit this information in a response,
if the information about the number of features is not known or difficult to compute.
If the value of the resultType parameter is set to "hits",
the value shall be set to "0", if provided.
=====================================================================

CAUTION: Related to link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/8[ISSUE 8] +
Define these as headers or include them in the payload? `timeStamp`, for example, does
not seem to be needed given the 'Date' HTTP header. For `numberMatched` and
`numberReturned` headers do not seem to be a good idea as, for example,
`numberReturned` can only be included at the end, if streaming is used.

=== Feature

==== Operation

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/f-op +

For every feature in a feature collection (path "/{collectionId}"),
the service SHALL support the HTTP GET operation at the path `/{collectionId}/{id}`.

`collectionId` is the property of the same name in the feature collection metadata.

`id` is the unique identifier of the feature within the dataset.
|===

NOTE: TODO +
Add more about the feature identifiers.

==== Response

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/f-success +

A successful execution of the operation SHALL be reported as a response with a
HTTP status code "200".
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/f-links +

A "200"-response SHALL include the following links in the response:

* a link to the response document (relation: `self`),
* a link to the response document in every other media type supported by the service (relation: `alternate`), and
* a link to the feature collection that contains this feature (relation: `collection`).

All links SHALL include the `rel` and `type` link parameters.
|===

NOTE: The representation of the links in the payload will depend on the encoding
of the feature collection.

.Links
=================
The links in a feature could be (in this example represented as link headers):

[source]
----
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings/123?f=json>; rel="self"; type="application/geo+json"
Link: <http://data.example.org/buildings/123?f=xml>; rel="alternate"; type="application/gml+xml;version=3.2"
