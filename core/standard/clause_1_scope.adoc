== Scope

This document specifies the interface to a general-purpose Web Processing Service (WPS) using a RESTful protocol transporting JSON encoded requests and responses. 
A WPS is a web service that enables the execution of computing processes and the retrieval of metadata describing their purpose and functionality. Typically, these processes combine raster, vector, and/or coverage data with well-defined algorithms to produce new raster, vector, and/or coverage information.
The document is an extension to the OGC WPS 2.0 Interface Standard [14-065].  It should be considered as another binding extension to HTTP/POST + XML and HTTP/GET + KVP as defined in Section 10 (Binding Extensions for WPS Operations) of the WPS 2.0 standard.
