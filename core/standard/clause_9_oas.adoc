== Requirements class "OpenAPI 3.0"

////
for now, normative statements are often included inline. This will be re-factored later.
////

=== Basic requirements

The API of servers conforming to this requirements class are defined by an link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#oasDocument[OpenAPI Document].

include::requirements/requirements_class_oas30.adoc[]

include::requirements/requirement_oas-definition.adoc[]

An example OpenAPI document is included in <<oas30_example,Annex C>>.

include::requirements/requirement_oas-impl.adoc[]

=== Complete definition

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/oas30/completeness +

The OpenAPI definition SHALL specify for each operation all
link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#httpCodes[HTTP Status Codes]
and
link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#responseObject[Response Objects]
that the server uses in responses.

This includes the successful execution of an operation as well as all error
situations that originate from the server.
|===

Note that servers that, for example, are access-controlled
(see <<security,Security>>), that support web cache validation, CORS
or that use HTTP redirection will make use of additional HTTP status codes
beyond regular codes like `200` for successful GET requests
and `400`, `404` or `500` for error situations.

NOTE: TODO +
Check, if the approach is consistent with the security concepts
identified in the upcoming "OGC Web Services Security" standard.

Clients should be prepared to receive responses not documented in the
OpenAPI definition. For example, additional errors may occur in the transport
layer outside of the server.

[[exceptions]]
=== Exceptions

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/oas30/exceptions-codes +

For error situations that originate from the server, the API definition
SHALL cover all applicable HTTP Status Codes.
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/oas30/exceptions-400 +

For error situations that are the result of a bad request by the client,
error code "400" SHALL be used.
|===

NOTE: TODO +
Add list of pre-defined WFS error codes for 400-responses,
including MissingParameterValue, InvalidParameterValue, OperationParsingFailed.

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/oas30/exceptions-500 +

For error situations that are the result of an internal server error,
error code "500" SHALL be used.
|===

NOTE: TODO +
Add list of pre-defined WFS error codes for 500-responses,
including NoApplicableCode, OperationProcessingFailed.

[[security]]
=== Security

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/oas30/security +

For cases, where the operations of the server are access-controlled,
the security scheme(s) SHALL be documented in the OpenAPI definition.
|===

The OpenAPI specification currently supports the following link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#security-scheme-object[security schemes]:

* HTTP authentication,
* an API key (either as a header or as a query parameter),
* OAuth2's common flows (implicit, password, application and access code) as defined in RFC6749, and
* OpenID Connect Discovery.

=== Feature collection metadata

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/oas30/fc-md-op +

The `operationId` of the HTTP GET operation for feature collection metadata
SHALL be "describeCollections".
|===

=== Feature collections

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/oas30/fc-key-properties +

The schema for the Response Objects of the HTTP GET operation for
feature collections SHOULD include key feature properties
of the features in the feature collection.

This is in particular helpful, if filter parameters are defined for the
collection (see recommendation `/rec/core/fc-filters`).
|===

=== Features

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/oas30/f-key-properties +

The schema for the Response Objects of the HTTP GET operation for
features SHOULD include key feature properties
of the features.
