== Media Types

JSON media types that would typically be used in a WPS that supports JSON are:

* `application/json` for all resources.

The typical HTML media type for all "web pages" in a WPS would be:

* `text/html`.

The media type for an OpenAPI definition in JSON is: 

* `application/openapi+json;version=3.0`.

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/117[ISSUE 117] +
The OpenAPI media type has not been registered yet with IANA and will likely change. We need to update the media type after registration.
