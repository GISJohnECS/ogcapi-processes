[[Callbacks]]
== Requirement Class "Callbacks"

This conformance class specifies a callback mechanism for completed jobs. In contrast to the pull-based machanism specified in section TODO, this conformance class specifies a push-based mechanism, where a subscriber-URL is passed to the API in the execute request. After the job is completed, the result response is sent to the specified URL.
