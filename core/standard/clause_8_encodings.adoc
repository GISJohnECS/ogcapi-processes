== Requirements classes for encodings

////
for now, normative statements are often included inline. This will be re-factored later.
////

=== Overview

This clause specifies four pre-defined requirements classes for encodings to be
used in a WFS. These encodings are commonly used encodings for spatial data on
the web:

* <<rc_html,HTML>>
* <<rc_geojson,GeoJSON>>
* <<rc_gmlsf0,Geography Markup Language (GML), Simple Features Profile, Level 0>>
* <<rc_gmlsf2,Geography Markup Language (GML), Simple Features Profile, Level 2>>

None of these encodings is mandatory and an implementation of the <<rc_core,Core>>
requirements class may also decide to use none of them, but to use another encoding
instead.

The <<rc_core,Core>> requirements class includes recommendations to support
<<rec_html,HTML>> and <<rec_geojson,GeoJSON>> as encodings, where practical.
<<overview,Clause 6 (Overview)>> includes a discussion about recommended
encodings.

=== Requirement Class "HTML"

NOTE: TODO +
Add intro text for the requirement class. +
Link to <<SDWBP>> and summarize the key points discussed around in BP2. +
Also link to <<rec_html>>.

|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/html/definition +

Every "200"-response of an operation of the server
SHALL support the media type `text/html`.
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/html/content +

Every "200"-response of the server with the media type "text/html" SHALL be a
link:https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/[HTML 5 document] that includes the following
information in the HTML body:

* all information identified in the schemas of the
link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#responseObject[Response Object]
in the HTML `<body/>`, and
* all links in HTML `<a/>` elements in the HTML `<body/>`.

In a "200"-response with the media type `text/html`, include
<<schema.org,Schema.org>> annotations.

=== Requirement Class "GeoJSON"

NOTE: TODO +
Add intro text for the requirement class.

include::requirements/requirements_class_geojson.adoc[]

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/geojson/definition +

"200"-responses of the server SHALL support the following media types:

* `application/json` for feature collection metadata, and
* `application/geo+json` for feature collections and features.
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/geojson/content +

Every "200"-response with the media type `application/geo+json` SHALL be

* a link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.3[GeoJSON FeatureCollection Object] for feature collections, and
* a link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.2[GeoJSON Feature Object] for features.

The links specified in the requirements `/req/core/fc-links` and
`/req/core/f-links` SHALL be added in a extension property
(foreign member) with the name `links`.

Templates for the definition of the schemas for the GeoJSON responses in
OpenAPI definitions are available at
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/schemas/featureCollectionGeoJSON.yaml[featureCollectionGeoJSON.yaml] and
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/schemas/featureGeoJSON.yaml[featureGeoJSON.yaml].
These are generic schemas that do not include any application schema information about
specific feature types or their properties.

=== Requirement Class "Geography Markup Language (GML), Simple Features Profile, Level 0"

|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/gmlsf0/content +

Every "200"-response with the media type `application/gml+xml;version=3.2;profile=http://www.opengis.net/def/profile/ogc/2.0/gml-sf0` SHALL be

* a link:http://schemas.opengis.net/wfs/3.0/wfs-core.xsd[WFS 3.0 Core FeatureCollection Object] for feature collections, and
* a link:http://schemas.opengis.net/gml/3.2.1/feature.xsd[GML 3.2 Feature] for features.

Every feature SHALL conform to the <<GMLSF,GML Simple Features Profile, Level 0>>.
|===

NOTE: TODO +
The WFS 3.0 Core FeatureCollection Object has to be an XML schema element defined according to 8.4.2 Defining feature collections. +
Add statements how links are represented.

Templates for the definition of the schemas for the GML responses in OpenAPI
definitions are available at

These are generic schemas that do not include any application schema information about
specific feature types or their properties.

=== Requirement Class "Geography Markup Language (GML), Simple Features Profile, Level 2"

NOTE: TODO +
Add intro text for the requirement class.
