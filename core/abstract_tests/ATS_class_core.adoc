Validate that the OGC API - Processes services, advertised through the API, conform with HTTP 1.1.

====== b) Pre-conditions:
none

====== c) Test Method:

. All compliance tests shall be configured to use the HTTP 1.1 protocol exclusively.  

====== d) References:
Requirement 7

==== Retrieve the API Description

===== Landing Page Retrieval

====== a) Test Purpose:
Validate that a landing page can be retrieved from the expected location.

====== b) Pre-conditions:

* A URL to the server hosting the landing page is known.

* The test client can authenticate to the server.

* The test client has sufficient privileges to access the landing page.

====== c) Test Method:

. Issue an HTTP GET request to the URL {root}/

. Validate that a document was returned with a status code 200

. Validate the contents of the returned document using test A.4.2.2

====== d) References:

===== OpenAPI Document Retrieval

Note: The URI for the API definition is provided through the landing page.  However, that does not mean that the API definition resides on the same server as the landing page.  Test clients should be prepared for a OGC API - Processes implementation which is distributed across multiple servers.

Validate that the API Definition document can be retrieved from the expected location.

====== b) Pre-conditions:

* A URL to the server hosting the API Definition document is known.

* The test client can authenticate to the server.

* The test client has sufficient privileges to assess the API Definition document.

====== c) Test Method:

. Issue an HTTP GET request to the URL {root}/api

. Validate that a document was returned with a status code 200

. Validate the contents of the returned document using test A.4.2.4

====== d) References:
Requirements 3 and 4

===== API Definition Validation

====== a) Test Purpose:
Validate that the API Definition page complies with the require structure and contents.

====== b) Pre-conditions:

* The API Definition document has been retrieved from the server

. Validate the API Definition document against the OpenAPI 3.0 schema

. Identify the Test Points as described in test A.4.3

. Process the API Definition document as described in test A.4.4

====== d) References:
Requirement 4

==== Identify the Test Points

Identification of the test points is a pre-condition to performing a compliance test. This process starts with A.4.3.1.

===== Identify Test Points:

====== a) Purpose:
To identify the test points associated with each Path in the OpenAPI document

====== b) Pre-conditions:

*   An OpenAPI document has been obtained
*   A list of URLs for the servers to be included in the compliance test has been provided
*   A list of the paths specified in the OGC API - Processes specification

====== c) Method:

FOR EACH paths property in the OpenAPI document
    If the path name is one of those specified in the OGC API - Processes specification
        Retrieve the Server URIs using A.4.3.2.
        FOR EACH Server URI
            Concatenate the Server URI with the path name to form a test point.
            Add that test point to the list.

====== d) References:
None

===== Identify Server URIs:

====== a) Purpose:
To identify all server URIs applicable to an OpenAPI Operation Object

====== b) Pre-conditions:

*   Server Objects from the root level of the OpenAPI document have been obtained
*   A Path Item Object has been retrieved
*   An Operation Object has been retrieved
*   The Operation Object is associated with the Path Item Object
*   A list of URLs for the servers to be included in the compliance test has been provided

====== c) Method:

1) Identify the Server Objects which are in-scope for this operation

 - IF Server Objects are defined at the Operation level, then those and only those Server Objects apply to that Operation.

 - IF Server Objects are defined at the Path Item level, then those and only those Server Objects apply to that Path Item.

 - IF Server Objects are not defined at the Operation level, then the Server Objects defined for the parent Path Item apply to that Operation.

 - IF Server Objects are not defined at the Path Item level, then the Server Objects defined for the root level apply to that Path.

 - IF no Server Objects are defined at the root level, then the default server object is assumed as described in the OpenAPI specification.

2) Process each Server Object using A.4.3.3.

3) Delete any Server URI which does not reference a server on the list of servers to test.

====== d) References:
None

===== Process Server Object:

====== a) Purpose:
To expand the contents of a Server Object into a set of absolute URIs.

====== b) Pre-conditions:

*   A Server Object has been retrieved

====== c) Method:

Processing the Server Object results in a set of absolute URIs.  This set contains all of the URIs that can be created given the URI template and variables defined in that Server Object.

. If there are no variables in the URI template, then add the URI to the return set.

. For each variable in the URI template which does not have an enumerated set of valid values:
    - generate a URI using the default value,
    - add this URI to the return set,
    - flag this URI as non-exhaustive
. For each variable in the URI template which has an enumerated set of valid values:
    - generate a URI for each value in the enumerated set,
    - add each generated URI to the return set.

. Perform this processing in an iterative manner so that there is a unique URI for all possible combinations of enumerated and default values.

. Convert all relative URIs to absolute URIs by rooting them on the URI to the server hosting the OpenAPI document.

====== d) References:
None
