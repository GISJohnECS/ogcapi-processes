^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/core/job-creation-input-cardinality-gt1*
^|Test Purpose |Validate the correct handling of input multiplicity when executing a process.
^|Requirement | <<req_core_job-creation-input-cardinality-gt1,req_core_job-creation-input-cardinality-gt1>>
^|Test Method |. Identify a process that has an input with a multiplicity greater than 1 (`maxOccurs>1`).
. Formulate a valid execute request for the chosen process that includes the selected input.
. Specify a number of values for the input, encoded as an array, that validate according the input's schema and of a multiplicity concordant with the `minOccurs` and `maxOccurs` facets defined for the input.
. Create a job according to the test <<ats_core_job-creation-op,/req/core/job-creation-op>>.
