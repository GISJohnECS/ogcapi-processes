test-purpose:: Validate that the server responds as expected when getting results from a job for a process that has been executed synchronously.

[.component,class=test method]
=====

[.component,class=step]
--
Get a description of each process offered by the server using test <<ats_core_process,/conf/core/process>>.
--

[.component,class=step]
--
Inspect the description of each process and identify the subset of processes that support the `sync-execute` job control option.
--

[.component,class=step]
--
For each identified process construct an execute request according to test <<ats_core_process-execute-request,/conf/core/process-execute-request>> ensuring that synchronous execution is <<sc_execution_mode,negotiated>> according to test <<ats_core_process-execute-default-execution-mode,/conf/core/process-execute-default-execution-mode>>.
--

[.component,class=step]
--
Inspect the headers of the response and see if a `Link` header is included with `rel=monitor`.
--

[.component,class=step]
--
If the link exists, get the job status as per test <<ats_core_job-op,/conf/core/job-op>> and ensure that the job status is set to `successful`.
