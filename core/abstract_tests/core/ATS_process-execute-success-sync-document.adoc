test-purpose:: Validate that the server responds as expected when synchronous execution is <<sc_execution_mode,negotiated>> and the response type is `document`.

[.component,class=test method]
=====
[.component,class=step]
--
Get a description of each process offered by the server using test <<ats_core_process-description,/conf/core/process-description>>.
--

[.component,class=step]
--
Inspect the description of each process and identify the subset of processes that support the `sync-execute` job control option.
--

[.component,class=step]
--
For each identified process construct an execute request according to test <<ats_core_process-execute-request,/conf/core/process-execute-request>> ensuring that synchronous execution has been <<sc_execution_mode,negotiated>> according to tests <<ats_core_process-execute-default-execution-mode,/conf/core/process-execute-default-execution-mode>> and the requested response type is `document` (i.e. `"response": "document"`) according to requirement <<req_core_process-execute-sync-document,/req /core/process-execute-sync-document>>.
--

[.component,class=step]
--
Verify that each process executes successfully according to requirement <<req_core_process-execute-sync-document,/req/core/process-execute-sync-document>>.
