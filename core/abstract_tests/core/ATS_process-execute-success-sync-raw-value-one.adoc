subject:: <<req_core_process-execute-sync-raw-value-one,/req/core/process-execute-sync-raw-value-one>>
test-purpose:: Validate that the server responds as expected when synchronous execution is <<sc_execution_mode,negotiated>>, a single output value is requested, the response type is `raw` and the output transmission is `value`.

=====
[.component,class=step]
--
Get a description of each process offered by the server using test <<ats_core_process-description,/conf/core/process-description>>.
--

[.component,class=step]
--
Inspect the description of each process and identify the subset of processes that generate at least one output and support the `sync-execute` job control option and the `value` output transmission.
--

[.component,class=step]
--
For each identified process construct an execute request according to test <<ats_core_process-execute-request,/conf/core/process-execute-request>> ensuring that synchronous execution is <<sc_execution_mode,negotiated>> according to test <<ats_core_process-execute-default-execution-mode,/conf/core/process-execute-default-execution-mode>>, that only one output is requested, that the requested response type is `raw` (i.e. `"response": "raw"`) and that the output transmission is set to `value` (i.e. `"transmissionMode": "value"`) according to requirement <<req_core_process-execute-sync-raw-value-one,/req/core/process-execute-sync-raw-value-one>>.
--

[.component,class=step]
--
Verify that each process executes successfully according to requirement <<req_core_process-execute-sync-raw-value-one,/req/core/process-execute-sync-raw-value-one>>.
