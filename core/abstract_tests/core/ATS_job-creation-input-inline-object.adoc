|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/core/job-creation-input-inline-object*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that inputs with a complex object schema encoded in-line in an execute request are correctly processed.
^|Test Method |. Get a description of each process offered by the server using test <<ats_core_process,/conf/core/process>>.
. Inspect the description of each process and identify the subset of processes that have inputs with complex `object schemas (i.e. inputs of type `object`).
. For each identified process construct an execute request according to test <<ats_core_job-creation-request,/conf/core/job-creation-request>> taking care to encode the identified object inputs in-line in the execute request according to requirement <<req_core_job-creation-input-inline-object,/req/core/job-creation-input-inline-object>>.
. Verify that each process executes successfully according to one or more of the tests <<ats_core_job-creation-success-async,/conf/core/job-creation-success-async>>, <<ats_core_job-creation-sync-document,/conf/core/job-creation-sync-document>>, <<ats_core_job-creation-sync-raw-ref,/conf/core/job-creation-sync-raw-ref>>, <<ats_core_job-creation-sync-raw-value-multi,/conf/core/job-creation-sync-raw-value-multi>> or <<ats_core_job-creation-sync-raw-value-one,/conf/core/job-creation-sync-raw-value-one>> depending on the parameters used in the execute request.
