[.component,class=test method]
=====
[.component,class=step]
--
Get a description of each process offered by the server using test <<ats_core_process,/conf/core/process>>.
--

[.component,class=step]
--
Inspect the description of each process and identify the subset of processes that have binary inputs.
--

[.component,class=step]
--
For each identified process construct an execute request according to test <<ats_core_process-execute-request,/conf/core/process-execute-request>> taking care to encode binary input values in-line in the execute request according to requirement <<req_core_process-execute-input-inline-binary,/req/core/process-execute-input-inline-binary>>.
--

[.component,class=step]
--
Verify that the server successfully executes each identified process according to the tests <<ats_core_process-execute-sync-one,/conf/core/process-execute-sync-one>>, <<ats_core_process-execute-sync-many-json,/conf/core/process-execute-sync-many-json>>, <<ats_core_process-execute-sync-one-default-content,/conf/core/process-execute-sync-one-default-content>> or <<ats_core_process-execute-success-async,/conf/core/process-execute-success-async>> based on the combination of execute parameters used in each case.
