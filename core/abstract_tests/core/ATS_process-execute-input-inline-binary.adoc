test-purpose:: Validate that binary input values encoded as base-64 string in-line in an execute request are correctly processes.

[.component,class=test method]
=====
[.component,class=step]
--
Get a description of each process offered by the server using test <<ats_core_process-description,/conf/core/process-description>>.
--

[.component,class=step]
--
Inspect the description of each process and identify the subset of processes that have binary inputs.
--

[.component,class=step]
--
For each identified process construct an execute request according to test <<ats_core_process-execute-request,/conf/core/process-execute-request>> taking care to encode binary input values in-line in the execute request according to requirement <<req_core_process-execute-input-inline-binary,/req/core/process-execute-input-inline-binary>>.
--

[.component,class=step]
--
Verify that each process executes successfully according to the <<ats-process-execute-success-sync,relevant requirement based on the combination of execute parameters.>>
