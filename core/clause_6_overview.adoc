== Overview

The OGC API - Processes builds on the WPS 2.0 standard and it is modularized, meaning that there is a separation between 
 
 * core requirements, that specify basic capabilities and can easily be mapped to existing OGC Web Processing Services, and
 * more advanced functionality, that was not specified in WPS 2.0.


=== Encodings

This standard uses JSON as encoding for requests and responses. The inputs and outputs of a process can have any format. The formats of are defined at the time of job creation and are fixed for the specific job.

<<rec_html,Support for HTML is recommended>> as HTML is the core language of the World Wide Web.
A server that supports HTML will support browsing with a web browser
and it will enable search engines to crawl and index the processes.
