# Web Processing Service 2.0 REST/JSON Binding Extension

This GitHub repository contains the REST/JSON Binding Extension of the [OGC](http://opengeospatial.org)'s
Web Processing Service (WPS) 2.0 standard for processing geospatial information on the web. It is a complete
rewrite of previous versions, focusing on a simple RESTful core specified
as reusable [OpenAPI](http://openapis.org) components with responses in JSON and HTML.

## Overview

A Web Processing Service is a web service that enables the execution of computing processes and the retrieval of metadata describing their purpose and functionality. 
Typically, these processes combine raster, vector, and/or coverage data with well-defined algorithms to produce new raster, vector, and/or coverage information.

```
GET /processes
```

Lists the processes this WPS offers. 

```
GET /processes/{process-id}
```

Returns a detailed description of a process.

```
GET /processes/{process-id}/jobs
```

Returns the running and finished jobs for a process.

```
POST /processes/{process-id}/jobs
```

Executes a process, i.e. creates a new job. Inputs and outputs will have to be specified in
a JSON document that needs to be send in the POST body.

```
GET /processes/{process-id}/jobs/{job-id}
```

Returns the status of a job of a process.

```
GET /processes/{process-id}/jobs/{job-id}/results
```

Returns the result of a job of a process.
